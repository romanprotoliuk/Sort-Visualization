# Visualizer for Sorting Algorithms 

* the technologies you plan on using
## Tech used
React

## Description 
In the past few weeks I've been learning a lot about different sorting algrorithms and how they work. This inspired me to make a sort visualizer tool. I would like to inlcude Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort algorithms in this visualizer tool. This will help me understand these algorithms and also practice my front end engineering skills. 

## Wireframes

## MVP 
* at least one algorithm (MergeSort) working properly on the canvas
* sort button
* reshuffle button  

## Daily Sprints
### Tuesday
* Research/Planning,
* Need to fully understand MergeSort
* Figure out an algorithm that randomly shuffles numbers 
* Basic app set up (button on click shows 0-500 numbers, display these numbers)
* Set up a bit of styiling to showcase bars, put numbers for pixel values, this should make these bars apear on the screen

### Wednesday 
* Implement Merge Sort Algorithm 
* Figure out how to trace algorthim steps and add animation to them 
* Apply styling to animation 

### Thursday 
* Implement Merge Sort Algorithm 
* Figure out how to trace algorthim steps and add animation to them 
* Apply styling to animation 

### Friday
* By this day Merge Sort should be working fine with animations 
* Make graph dynamic to any screen size
* Start implementing Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort

### Saturday 
* implementation of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort

### Sunday 
* Add dynamic array change toggle 
* better styling
